**Team Members:**
- Abdullah Nasir  
- Zainab Asif  
- Atqa Asma    

**Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)  
**University:** Bahria University BSE-3B  

## General Information

This project is a **Banking Management System** developed as part of the DSA course project. The system is implemented in C++ and makes extensive use of **Data Structures**, **STLs**, and efficient algorithms to simulate a real-life banking solution.

### Objective

The project assumes ownership of a bank operating **10 ATMs** in a city. The system is designed to handle **banking operations** and **ATM management**, ensuring seamless functionality and user interaction. It incorporates persistent data storage, enabling information to be saved across executions.

### Banking Mode

| Command | Description                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| S       | Open bank                      |
| O       | Open an account                |
| B       | Balance enquiry                |
| W       | Withdrawal                     |
| D       | Deposit                        |
| C       | Close account                  |
| A       | Activate ATM                   |
| U       | Unlock ATM                     |
| P       | Print all accounts             |
| I       | Apply interest to all accounts |
| E       | Exit and close all accounts    |

### ATM Mode

| Command | Description     |
| ------- | --------------- |
| X       | PIN change      |
| F       | Fund transfer   |
| B       | Balance enquiry |
| W       | Withdrawal      |
| M       | Mini statement  |

**Note:** Data persistence ensures all banking and ATM records are saved after each session, enabling seamless restoration upon the next execution.
